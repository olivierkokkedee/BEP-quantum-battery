# BEP-quantum-battery
There are different .py files I have used to carry out all numerical calculations. The main file - BEP_code_correct_inclHb.py - contains the calculations for the energy and fluctuations. The evaluation files and find_true_max.py contains the code for plotting. It is important to note that these files change a lot (whenever I want a different plot as a function of J or N).
I've added some notes in the code as well, so I hope that helps for reading the code.
